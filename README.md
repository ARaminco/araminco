# 👋 Hey, I’m Aliasghar Ramin — a.k.a araminco

I’m a backend developer and startup strategist, driven by a deep curiosity to solve real-world problems with clean code and scalable systems. My work lives at the intersection of **technology**, **creativity**, and **business growth**.

I’m here to **create tools**, **craft systems**, and **connect ideas** — all with code.

## 🧬 Philosophy Behind “araminco”

> While most people think **co** stands for "company", for me, it's something different:  
> **co = creator • coder • connector**  

It reflects my mission to **build**, **collaborate**, and **create impact** — through code, clarity, and connection.
